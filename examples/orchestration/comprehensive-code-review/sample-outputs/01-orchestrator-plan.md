# Sample Output: Orchestrator Planning Phase

## Orchestrator Agent Activated

I'll coordinate a comprehensive review of the authentication module.

### Codebase Analysis

Let me first understand the scope:

- **Files to review:** 8 files in `src/auth/`
- **Lines of code:** ~1,200
- **Recent changes:** 3 commits in last week
- **Test coverage:** 45% (below target)

### Review Plan

Creating a structured review plan:

```
Todo List:
1. [x] Analyze codebase structure and recent changes
2. [ ] Delegate to code-reviewer for quality analysis
3. [ ] Delegate to security-auditor for vulnerability scan
4. [ ] Delegate to test-architect for coverage analysis
5. [ ] Delegate to refactorer for improvement opportunities
6. [ ] Delegate to docs-writer for documentation check
7. [ ] Synthesize findings into prioritized summary
```

### Files Identified for Review

| File | Size | Last Modified | Priority |
|------|------|---------------|----------|
| `src/auth/jwt.js` | 245 lines | 2 days ago | High |
| `src/auth/middleware.js` | 180 lines | 1 week ago | High |
| `src/auth/login.js` | 320 lines | 3 days ago | High |
| `src/auth/register.js` | 290 lines | 3 days ago | Medium |
| `src/auth/password.js` | 165 lines | 2 weeks ago | Medium |

### Delegation Strategy

I'll delegate in this order:
1. **Code reviewer** first - establishes baseline quality
2. **Security auditor** - critical for auth code
3. **Test architect** - coverage is below target
4. **Refactorer** - after understanding issues
5. **Docs writer** - last, after code stabilizes

Starting code quality review...
